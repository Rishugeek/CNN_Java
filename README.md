Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented entirely from scratch using Java. The primary goal was to deepen my understanding of neural network fundamentals and explore Java's capabilities for implementing complex algorithms.

What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs are particularly effective for tasks involving image recognition and classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns.

Key components of CNNs include:

Convolutional Layers: Apply convolutional filters to input data to extract features.
Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity into the model, commonly using ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining important features.
Fully Connected Layers: Combine features learned in previous layers to make final predictions.
Project Details
In this project, I built a CNN from scratch using Java. The implementation involved:

Designing the Network Architecture: I created the architecture of the CNN, including layers for convolution, activation, pooling, and fully connected components.
Implementing Convolutional Operations: Developed the algorithms for applying convolutional filters to input images, performing feature extraction.
Applying Activation Functions: Implemented ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity.
Implementing Pooling Layers: Added max pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps.
Building the Fully Connected Layers: Integrated dense layers to output predictions based on the features extracted by previous layers.
Training and Evaluation: Developed methods for training the network using backpropagation and evaluating its performance on a dataset.
Learning Outcomes
By building this CNN from scratch, I gained hands-on experience with fundamental deep learning concepts and learned how to implement complex neural network operations in Java. This project also provided insights into the practical challenges of developing neural networks and optimizing their performance.
